# Lab 02: jQuery and the DOM

Work with the provided starter code to add structure and functionality for a basic Blog web site.

The code has some unfinished features. Your help is needed to complete it!

Search through the code for:

 `// TODO: ...`

 comments, where features should be. Replace the comments and any related pseudo-code with real, working code.

Work in pairs. Take turns as "driver" and "navigator".

## Submit your assignment

When you are finished with lab (or if the 2 hour time limit runs out), please submit your work. To do this, create *one* Pull Request (PR) to the original class repo with your changes. Both of you will submit that same PR link in Canvas.

1. Ensure that all your local changes are committed and pushed to your `origin` repo.
2. Visit the original repo on github.com (or just type `git open` in the terminal if you have that package installed).
1. Create a new PR and ensure the branches look correct.
1. Fill in the template based on the text box prompts:
  1. Write a good descriptive summary of your changes:
    - Be sure to include how much time you spent on it, and who you worked with.
    - Briefly reflect on and summarize your process.
1. When you create the PR, it will have a unique URL. Copy this link, share with your partner, and paste it into the assignment submission form in Canvas. Both the driver and the navigator will submit the same PR link.
