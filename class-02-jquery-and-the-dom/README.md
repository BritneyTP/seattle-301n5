# Class 2 - jQuery and the DOM

## Daily Plan

1. jQuery Intro
2. Assignments - Blog & Portfolio
3. Lab Workflow for blog assignments

jQuery is a powerful JavaScript library that gives developers a new way of interacting with the DOM. In lecture and assignments, you'll get a taste of what it can do and practice using it to build your own apps.

## Pair assignments

Throughout this course, you'll have a structured way to do "pair programming" with your classmates. You will have the opportunity to work with a number of your classmates, benefiting from their background and perspective, whether it's technical or otherwise.

Full instructions for what to do are found in your first pair assignment. See the `README.md` file in the `pair-assignment` folder.
